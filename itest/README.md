# Integration Test

[![grunt](https://github.com/objectionary/eoc/actions/workflows/itest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/objectionary/eoc/actions/workflows/itest.yml)

There is a simple integration test here. Just run this to make sure
it works:

```bash
../src/eoc.js dataize program
```

Then, you can execute the unit tests too:

```bash
../src/eoc.js test
```

If doesn't work, submit an issue.
